# Introduction

Magic Console is a developer tool that runs source code and visualizes the output. It can be used for a lot of different purposes:

* Trying code, exploring results
* Testing code and visualizing test results
* Documenting code and providing interactive code examples
* Developing custom developer tools

In the following sections, I will demonstrate how Magic Console can be used to create interactive documentation. Each of the sections are Javascript files as opposed to Markdown files. To read them, open the file in Atom and run them using Magic Console (<kbd>CMD+ENTER</kbd> on OS X and <kbd>CTRL+ENTER</kbd> on Linux/Windows).

1. [stdio](/1-stdio.js): Sending output from source code to Magic Console
2. [Plugins](/2-plugins.js): Visualizing output using plugins
